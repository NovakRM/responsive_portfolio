mobile responsive bootstrap portfolio 
base code consists of three pages: index/bio page, portfolio with links to other content, and a currently non-operational contact page.

Updates: 
-   Restyled containers, rounded out corners
-   Transparency that doesn't bother an elements children achieved! 
-   Changed font to sans serif family
-   Restyled with new color palette 
-   Added alt text to images

Additions: 
-   Social media links added as icons, styled to sit next to / below bio
-   Used Figures to attach captions to each portfolio image, added style rules
    (Took a look at @ForgetfulMind's code for the figure solution) 

Questions / To-Do:
-   Find better way to have social links scale in mobile viewports.
